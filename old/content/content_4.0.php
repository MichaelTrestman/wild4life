<p class="partners">Our ﬁeld partners are the key to our success. They contribute their resources, infrastructure, and relationships with local communities. They are also the starting point for the program. The staff of the partner organization are the ﬁrst to get tested for HIV, and as a group they are the people to spread the word that drives demand. They give us credibility with local communities. Our partners beneﬁt directly, as their staff are at the core of program activities and they are able to contribute to their surrounding communities by bringing much needed healthcare services into the area, usually where none previously exist.</p>

We currently manage about 500 conservation projects in more than 60 countries; and educate millions of visitors at our ﬁve living institutions in New York City on important issues affecting our planet. Our parks include: the Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo and Queens Zoo.
