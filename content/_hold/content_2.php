<h1>Results</h1>
<p>
Since starting in 2008, we've already made real and lasting impact through programs established in 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We've demonstrated that this is a delivery model that works. It connects remote rural communities with health services and has been effective at establishing HIV prevention and treatment in the communities that we work with &mdash; all at a cost of less than $10 per person.

<h3>Results at a glance</h3>
<div class="header_divider"></div>

<p>Since Wild4life's inception in 2008, we have established programs at multiple sites in 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Our model is scalable, easily replicable, and provides a cost-effective alternative for delivering health services to unserved rural areas in Africa. We work with state health services, Population Services International, and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation and other NGOs to deliver an array of services.</p>

<div id="results1">
<p>We have set up mobile clinics to reach unserved communities in areas where health services were previously unavailable, offering routine HIV testing and treatment, and treatment for other common diseases.</p>

<p>We have developed a method using group dynamics that results in very high rates of voluntary HIV testing amongst program participants &mdash; over 85%.</p>

<p>We have established regularized HIV community programs, including HIV education, recurring testing, prevention initiatives, ART, and male circumcision. PMTCT is in the works.</p>

<p>We have measured adherence to treatment in the longer-term as high as 88% due to an active case management program in communities that we work with.</p>

<p>The program has already made lasting change. Our cost-effective model gets people into the cycle of education and treatment. Once they're in, they become part of the solution. The best part is that it's cheap, at less than $10 / person.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and evaluation</h3>
<div class="header_divider"></div>
<img src="img/results/subphoto_2.jpg" alt="" title="" border="0" align="left" class="subphoto">
<div style="position: relative; float: left; width: 555px;">
<p>Wild4life strongly believes in measuring our impact on the communities that we serve. Monitoring and evaluation isn't just for reporting, it's a tool to refine what we do. Also, we're committed to sharing what we learn, and the delivery model, with other organizations.</p>

<div id="results2">
<p>We collect "hard" data, for example, the number of people participating in programs, or the number of people testing positive for HIV and going on to treatment, but we're also interested in the softer aspects, such as how the programs are changing social behaviours that put people at risk, or reducing discrimination against people living with HIV. It's as important for us to understand the social effects of our programs on the communities that we work with, as it is to collect the "hard" data. Wild4life's monitoring and evaluation program is built around the program's components. We're interested in what's working and what's not (and why).</p>

<h3>Changing social norms</h3>
<div class="header_divider"></div>
<img src="img/results/subphoto_3.jpg" alt="" title="" border="0" align="left" class="subphoto">
<div style="position: relative; float: left; width: 555px;">
<p>AIDS is a silent epidemic &mdash; in many communities it's not talked about freely and people affected by the disease have to deal with social isolation, stigma, and discrimination. Not talking about the disease often leaves people misinformed about the disease itself and how it can be treated. As a result they are reluctant to get tested and the cycle is perpetuated. Wild4life's intervention gives people practical information about HIV and, by mobilizing communities around testing, starts the discussion that is vital to changing the way that a community thinks about HIV and health in general.</p>
<div id="results3">
<p>We've been surprised by how fast attitudes towards people affected by the disease, and social norms subscribed to by communities, can change. It starts with getting people to do something concrete, like get tested for HIV, then using this to open a broader, on-going discussion that spreads through social networks in communities. It really can change the way a community thinks.</p>

<h3>How it works on the ground: Zimbabwe</h3>
<div class="header_divider"></div>
<img src="img/results/subphoto_4.jpg" alt="" title="" border="0" align="left" class="subphoto">
<div style="position: relative; float: left; width: 555px;">
<p>Wild4life partners with the Painted Dog Conservation project (PDC) in a remote corner of Matabeleland in western Zimbabwe. PDC employs about 50 local people in its conservation efforts and is a well established entity with local communities in the area. This semi-arid region has a highly dispersed and impoverished rural population with very high HIV prevalence and virtually no access to healthcare services, including services for HIV. For the most part, this is a practical issue. For example, the distance to the only local clinic, at Hwange, about 50 miles from the project. Transport is either unavailable or unaffordable for most people and few service providers ever visit the area.</p>
<div id="results4">
<p>With the medical staff of the clinic at Hwange, St Patricks, Wild4life has established a mobile clinic system, staffed by local doctors and counselors, that now routinely visit three previously unserved sites in the area. They offer VCT, HIV treatment and care, and treatment for other commonly associated diseases. In the first year of operation, as a direct result of the program, over 18,000 people have visited the mobile clinics, many seeing a doctor for the first time. 2500 people have tested for HIV at the sites. Of those, 712 proved to be infected with HIV and now are receiving treatment and routine follow-up as part of the on-going program.</p>

<p>PDC has implemented condom distribution, a peer-to-peer education initiative, and a male circumcision program in conjunction with Population Services International.</p>

<p>Currently, we're in discussion with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in Zimbabwe to establish a PMTCT program at the PDC sites.</p>

<p>PDC has joined forces with Wilderness Safaris in the area, a regional safari operator, and the Zimbabwe National Parks service to increase the reach of the program.</p>

<p>Wild4life supports local medical staff with stipends to supplement meager state salaries, and has assisted with a range of issues that they face, including provision of basic medical materials and diagnostic equipment.</p>

<p>The cost in Zimbabwe has been around $11 per participant in the program, and this under some of the most extreme conditions that we've encountered anywhere in Africa. It's proving a cost-effective way of reaching large numbers of people in remote rural areas and of making efficient use of resources already in-country.</p>
