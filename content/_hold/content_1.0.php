<h1>What We Do</h1>
<p>
We address the huge unmet need for health services in rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa by mobilizing communities, creating demand, connecting them to health service providers, and managing a co-ordinated response.

<h3>Mobilize communities and create demand</h3>

We've found that communities will mobilize around HIV, and in most of the areas that we work, HIV is the big health issue. It provides a focus to organize communities around and creates momentum by starting to get people to talk about health issues. We get people involved around HIV testing, this gets those that need it on to treatment and launches HIV prevention activities in the community. As the community begins to organize around HIV, we layer on a second wave of health programs aimed at diseases like TB and malaria. Our experience has been that it's hard for supply to keep up with demand as communities realize the benefits these programs can have.

<h3>Connect communities to providers</h3>

Health services don't just happen. In the rural areas, the dual problems of a delivery infrastructure and demand generation in dispersed rural populations need to be addressed first. A co-ordinated response works best for both communities and providers. For communities it means benefiting from an array of health services, and for providers, it means not having to incur the costs of developing their own infrastructure in rural areas, nor having to do their own demand creation, with the costs that involves. Wild4life provides both of these aspects and co-ordinates providers to deliver a range of health services in areas where none previously existed.

<h3>What's in it for field partners and service providers?</h3>

We enable existing health service providers to increase their reach and impact by providing a ready-made delivery infrastructure in areas that they usually don't operate, connecting them with rural communities, and generating demand. We solve the dual problems of a delivery infrastructure in rural areas and demand creation in dispersed rural populations. Our field partners, e.g. conservation or agricultural NGOs, or safari companies, benefit through the improved health of their staff and gain a critical new service to provide to communities where they operate.
