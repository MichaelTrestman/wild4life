<h1>Where We Work</h1>
<p>
Wild4life serves people in remote, rural communities who have limited or no access to health service providers. We have partnered with a range of organizations, including wildlife conservation and agricultural NGOs, private game reserves, and commercial safari operators, to establish health services, including HIV prevention and treatment programs, in 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

<h3>Personal Stories</h3>
<div class="header_divider"></div>


<img src="img/where/profile_1.jpg" alt="" title="" border="0" align="left" class="subphoto">
<h4>Zimbabwe</h4>
<p>I am Mrs Sophie Dube*. I am 39 years old, I have four children and my husband died of HIV last year. I had not known about my status until Painted Dog Conservation started the out reach program in Lupote.</p>
<div id="story1">
<p>It was not easy at first to go to the nearest clinic to my home, which is in Dete, so I went to Lupote Clinic, where none of the nurses knew me. At that time I was very ill and had come to ask for help for food from Painted Dog. My husband was not showing any signs of illness and I had TB.</p>

<p>My husband and I were both unemployed, my husband did odd jobs here and there while I sell tomatoes and fruits to passing buses on the highway and so we could not afford to travel the 100km to Hwange Town, to St Patrick's Hospital for testing or treatment. One thing I have learnt is that people don't want to know you when you are ill.
My CD4 was 13 when I started ARV's and I also got to a stage when I could not walk. In the meantime, my husband had no sings or symptoms at all. I have been married to only one man in my life. I was married to him when I was 16, which is normal in my world.</p>

<p>8 months down the line after taking my ARV's, I began to put on weight and finally when you look at me today, I am nice, pretty looking, round as what African women should be. Today as I speak to you my CD4 is 784.</p>

<p>When I spoke to my husband and asked him to get tested and get treatment, his answer was that he does not have too, as he was not ill, but that did not last long. Early last year he became so ill and by the time be was willing to test, it was too late and I buried him late last year.</p>

<p>I am sure that there are a lot of women out there with the same story, our cultural ways are very different and women have to abide by their husbands and sometimes that is not in our favor.</p>

<p>To date I have never missed treatment since I know my life and my children's lives depends on it. My attitude towards appreciating life has changed. I had given up hope and now its like I have been born again or given a new chance. I see life from a different angle.</p>

<p>HIV is a serous disease in our communities, which has touched each and every family and continues to affect us every day of our lives. Our rural communities are worst affected. Poverty, lack of education and cultures are difficult subjects to address and are difficult wars to win.</p>

<h4>Zimbabwe</h4>
<p>My name is Gertrude Moyo* and am 47 years. I have three children 26, 18 and 12 years old. I have been married and recently have been separated with my husband. I work for Painted Dog Conservation in the administration office and am a member of our HIV program.</p>

<div id="story2">
<p>I have been tested and am proud to know my status. Before I was tested, it worried me a lot, just thinking whether I was positive or not. Testing gave me a peace of mind and actually allowed me to sleep peacefully at night.</p>

<p>I did not have enough courage to go to the clinic and test but when Forgie, our HIV co-ordinator, started the Wild4life program with St Patricks Hospital, we thought she was crazy and wanted to get rid of us at work. However the support that the program gives us and assurance from our Management team helped us to understand that life does not end with HIV but can be a new beginning to a better life.</p>

<p>We women at PDC are all friends and we have learnt that we can support each other. We have formed our own family and encourage those who need treatment not to miss the visits from the St Patricks Hospital doctors.</p>

<p>My HIV positive friends are a great, strong pillar to me. Their drive and understanding for life is completely changed making them better people than before or than I am. Their attitude and drive towards life has turned around and they actually seem to live life at its fullest.</p>

<p>If anyone had to visit PDC, you would not be able to tell who is positive and who is negative. HIV has become an open topic to both men and women.</p>

<p>Testing should not be only done when you think you are ill but should be a requirement at anytime even if you are not ill. Testing and counseling will help you to understand HIV and help you accept other people that have it.
HIV is now a disease that is found in almost every family and is difficult to understand if you have not been counseled or tested yourself.</p>

<p>Gone are the days that HIV will make you ill or kill you. You can beat it and ARV's will allow you to have a normal life. The amazing thing about ARV's is that you can outlive some people that are negative if you are on ARV's.
I am always talking for my children about HIV and I would like to encourage other woman to know their status, teach our children and support our friends.</p>

<p>I want to thank Painted Dog Conservation and Wild4life for making this possible.</p>

<h4>Rwanda</h4>
<p>My name is Banda Kirezi*, I have been working with WCS since 1980s. I am living in the village called Banda which is neighboring Nyungwe National Park in Rwanda. I knew that I am HIV positive before Wild4life came to our organization and was difficult to access treatment as I was supposed to do many hours walking going either Kibogora hospital which is far away from my home or Cyato health center.</p>

<div id="story3">
<p>After knowing that I am HIV positive, I was scared that I was going to lose my job as it requires physical fitness and I was starting to feel very weak as my CD4 was reduced. I started taking treatment but it was difficult to access hospitals. It is after the Wild4life came to work closely with our organization that I got help from them to access treatment by providing transport but also Wild4life helped a lot in education of myself and my wife in different education session we had and that helped to understand well what measure to take and how to manage conflict within family due to my HIV status. I appreciate a lot these kind of education sessions with our family that are prepared with support from Wild4life as they give us more knowledge and skills about HIV/AIDS but also the way they help people to know their status by doing voluntary testing every year. Now I am doing well and fulfilling my tasks as normal.</p>
